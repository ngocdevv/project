# Wedding Invitation

This project wraps the Figma Make export in a Vite + React toolchain so you can run and iterate on it locally.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18.18+ (or any version supported by Vite 5)
- npm 9+ or another compatible package manager

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start a development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Preview the production build:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

The UI styles rely on Tailwind CSS utility classes exported by Figma Make, so keep the Tailwind pipeline enabled when moving files around.
